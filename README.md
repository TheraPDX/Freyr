*WORK IN PROGRESS: Still in greenfield development*

Pivot of the old GardenSpark project into go.

A full stack application run through docker.  UI in ReactJS, scalable api backend written in Go, load balanced with Nginx.

This is the server backend that aggregates data from collections of plant environmental sensors and provides a user interface to visualize and interact with that data.

Named after the norse god associated with fertility, sunshine, and fair weather.

More gooder words to come later.
